# GRIPTask1
Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours.
Steps invloved:
1.	Importing the necessary libraries.
2.	Importing the dataset.
3.	Data Pre-processing: Here, we will be splitting the dataset into X and Y columns, checking for any missing values, categorical values, outliers and so on and dealing with them in an effective manner.
4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this step, we will be checking if the features have a linear relationship with the target.
5.	Splitting the dataset into train and test sets: In our implementation of this project, we have used K-fold cross validation to split our dataset into train, validation and test sets. Using K-fold cross validation not only gives us a better coefficient of determination but also prevents overfitting of the model.
6.	Training the model: We train our dataset using different models.
7.	Prediction: Predicting the Chance of Admission.
8.	 Measuring the accuracy scores and comparing the models.
